## Deepfake Video Threats

Deepfake attacks are not yet a significant threat as ransomware or malware, but [dark web chatter](https://cybermagazine.com/cyber-security/deepfakes-become-growing-trend-2022-says-intsights) has indicated that threat actors are taking the technology seriously and considering ways to monetize the technology. 

As Deepfake technology improves and becomes more accessible, the threat scenarios involving Deepfake technology will expand and will become more common. Therefore, now is the time to prepare for future attacks by understanding the capabilities of this technology and how it can be deployed in a malicious manner. Most of all, cybersecurity professionals need to become proficient in being able to detect the fake from the real thing, which will become increasingly harder as Deepfake artists perfect their skills and become more creative. 

As an example of how convincing current Deepfake video technology can be, take a look at this impressive Deepfake video using the image of Tom Cruise. If you were not told that this was a Deepfake video, would you be able to tell the difference between the real thing and the fake?

Just imagine the future potential and threats that will develop from this technology in the hands of malicious actors, criminals, and governments. Possible attack scenarios could include the following:

 
**Deepfake Blackmail**
Criminals could produce fake videos putting individual in compromising scenarios and threaten to expose the video to the media or to law enforcement unless a ransom is paid. Since the general public and many in law enforcement or judges are not aware of capabilities of Deepfake technology, a good quality Deepfake video will likely be believed by the average viewer, thus destroying a persons reputation and credibility, which will be hard to recover. 

**Deepfake False-Evidence**
Imagine being accused of a crime that you did not commit simply because an “anonymous witness” turned in a video showing that you committed the crime. You could potentially be accused of a hate crime, assault, terrorist threat, vandalism, trespassing, or a more serious crime because someone set you up by creating a Deepfake video using your image. Think of the challenge trying to explain how the person that looks just like you in the video, is really not you, to a judge and jury. 


**Deepfake Stock Manipulation**
What if threat actors wanted to profit by manipulating the price fluctuation of a company’s stock, so to execute their plan, they create a Deepfake video of the CEO making an alarming statement that causes panic-selling of the stock. Threat actors can easily profit through investment vehicles like stock options, while remaining undetected, as the company is in damage control mode to mitigate the bad press and attempt to prove the video is fake to a skeptical audience. 


**Deepfake Political Campaign Ads**
It is the final days of a campaign and a video is leaked to the media of a political opponent that destroys  their chances of victory. After the election is over, it is revealed that the video was a Deepfake, but it is too late because a victor has been declared and made official. This scenario could be the future of politics as political opponents and hacktivists use Deepfake technology to attack their opponents and attempt to manipulate elections and sway public opinion. 

**Deepfake Attacks for Hire**
No need to know how Deepfake technology works or how it is deployed. Deepfake engineers can easily offer their expertise for hire on the dark web, in the same way malware and ransomware technology and attacks can be purchased on the dark web now.  

Before we close out this article, we do not want to leave our readers with the idea that Deepfake technology is all bad. There are beneficial and legitimate uses of the technology for movie productions and more. However, like everything else, things intended for legal purposes and for good, can always be used and exploited for evil in the hands of a criminal or wicked people. 

So, now is the time for cybersecurity professionals, law enforcement, journalists, attorneys, and judges to become familiar with how this technology can be manipulated to protect future victims and to ensure fair justice, rather than believing everything we see on video, which we now know cannot be trusted.
