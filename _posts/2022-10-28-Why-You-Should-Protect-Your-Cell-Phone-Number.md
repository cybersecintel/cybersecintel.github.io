**Your Number is the Master Key**

Owning a cell phone is all about making yourself more accessible and connecting with others, right? That's right! In contrast, since many apps and services rely on your cell phone number to access accounts or authenticate your identity, it may make sense to keep your number private. It is also possible for others to track your location or completely take over and control your cell phone by first knowing your number. Your number is the master key to your whole life. 

**Potential Attacks**

1) Using your phone number, scammers can access a lot of information about you, such as your date of birth, your home address, the names of your children, whether you have a criminal record, whether you have ever filed for bankruptcy, your previous employers, or even information related to your passwords, like your pet name (a very bad password choice). If one searches your phone number on one or more of the many online people search databases, they will be able to find a wealth of information about you. 

2) Using all the information scammers can collect online, they can contact your cell phone carrier pretending to be you. It is possible for them to claim their/your phone has been lost or damaged, and have a new SIM card activated from your carrier, giving them complete access to your phone. In this case, your phone is hijacked through a SIM card swap. Hijackers will then have access to all your text messages and calls, to include those with two-factor authentication (2FA) codes to gain access to accounts. 

3) Hackers can use your cell phone number to impersonate you and scam your contacts. An attack like this is referred to as "spoofing" because attackers call or send texts from Voice Over IP (VoIP) apps that display your phone number on another party's caller ID, rather than their real number. Friends, family, or business associates may trust the text or call believing it comes from you and fall victim to phishing scams or download viruses.

4) If hackers use your phone number as a master key to all your other accounts, they then have the ability to purchase products and services in your name and on your credit card.

**Take Action**

This list of attacks are some of the most obvious examples, but should not be viewed as the only attacks possible. Attacks are only limited to the imagination and capabilities of an attacker. The key point to be made by these examples is that knowledge of your devices phone number can compromise you and put you at risk. With that in mind, let us now consider a stretgy you can implement to protect your phone number and thus protect your many accounts associated with your cell number. 

First, you need an alternative number that you can give out to the public, to retailers that ask for your number at the register, or for your business card and website. Using this alternative number protects your true number that has been assigned to your device by your carrier. Services like Google Voice, 8x8, RingCentral, and other VoIP providers can provide a perfect alternative for adding a second or third number.

Second, a third number could also be obtained that could be used exclusively for your inner circle of friends, family, schools, and business associates. You may also want to use this third number for online retailers that require two-factor authentication or to identify you, but would not be catastrophic if someone breached that account. 

Third, the number assigned to your device by your carrier can be reserved for communication with your carrier and for accounts that could be a critical incident if they were breached like banking, credit card, insurance, and mortgage accounts. 

Along with protecting your phone from shoulder surfing, password protecting access to your device, and utilizing a VPN, a second and third number will also avoid hackers and scammers from gaining access to your master key-- your carrier assigned cell phone number.
