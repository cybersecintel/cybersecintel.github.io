Malicious Deepfake attacks are a growing cyber threat. Rather than stealing pictures from the social media sites of others to create fake profile identities, which can be easily detected with a simple [Google image search](https://images.google.com/), malicious attackers can now instantly create profile pics of none existent people. This makes the fake social media profiles of attackers much more effective for their social engineering based attacks. Deepfake image generators like [Deepfacelab](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab), [Faceswap](https://faceswap.dev/), and [Reface](https://hey.reface.ai/) are readily available online and fairly easy to use.  

While a trained eye or certain tools can detect deepfake image flaws, those flaws can be edited out of an image by using photo editing tools to pass the scrutiny of even the best Cybersecurity team. 

You can test your ability to detect deepfake images by visiting: [https://www.whichfaceisreal.com/](https://www.whichfaceisreal.com/)

The following person is AI generated from a website based tool: [This-Person-Does-not-Exist.com](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en)

Although this image appears to be a real person, it is nothing more than a computer generated image that has been created by a machine. Yet, a malicious actor can use this image to create a social media profile, add the image to dating sites for a dating scam, use it on a website with similar images to create a whole team of fake employees or even use this image with other technology to create deepfake videos. The possibilities are endless.
