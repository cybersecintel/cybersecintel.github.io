Malicious Deepfake technology is a growing cyber threat. Rather than stealing pictures from the social media sites of others to create fake profile identities, which can be easily detected with a simple [Google image search](https://images.google.com/), malicious attackers can now instantly create profile pics of none existent people. This makes the fake social media profiles of attackers much more effective for their social engineering based attacks. Deepfake image generators like [Deepfacelab](https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab), [Faceswap](https://faceswap.dev/), and [Reface](https://hey.reface.ai/) are readily available online and fairly easy to use.  

While a trained eye or certain tools can detect deepfake image flaws, those flaws can be edited out of an image by using photo editing tools to pass the scrutiny of even the best Cybersecurity team. 

You can test your ability to detect deepfake images by visiting: [https://www.whichfaceisreal.com/](https://www.whichfaceisreal.com/)

The following are images of AI generated people from the website: [This-Person-Does-not-Exist.com](https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en)

Although these images appear to be real, none of these people exist in real life, they are nothing more than computer generated people/images. Yet, a malicious actor can use these images to creat social media profiles, content, or even swap these faces to create deepfake videos.
